### 🔗 [Scalable URL Shortener Microservice](https://github.com/kaziiriad/url-shortener-scalable) 🥈
**High Complexity - Decoupled Microservices Architecture**

**High-performance URL shortener with three independent services, dual database strategy, and production K3s deployment**

- **Architected decoupled microservices** separating `create_service` (write-heavy), `redirect_service` (95% read traffic), and `worker_service` (Celery tasks) with independent scaling via `docker-compose-decoupled.yml`.
- **Implemented Redis-first caching** with MongoDB fallback and Nginx proxy routing, targeting **sub-5ms redirect latency** for optimal user experience.
- **Built repository pattern** with abstract base classes for PostgreSQL and MongoDB, centralized error handling, and shared `common/` library for clean data access across services.
- **Optimized PostgreSQL operations** using atomic key acquisition with `SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` for race-free distributed key allocation and parameterized bulk inserts for 100K+ keys.
- **Implemented comprehensive observability** using `OpenTelemetry` with B3 propagation, automatic FastAPI/DB instrumentation, OTLP export to `Tempo` for distributed tracing and `Grafana` visualization.
- **Engineered production-grade resilience** with `PgBouncer` connection pooling (**53% reduction** in overhead), circuit breaker pattern preventing cascade failures, exponential backoff retries, and database timeout protection.
- **Deployed production K3s cluster on AWS** using `Pulumi` IaC and `Ansible` with path-based Nginx routing, per-service rate limiting, and CI/CD pipeline via `GitHub Actions`.
- **Implemented intelligent key pre-population** using `Celery` workers maintaining pool of unused keys for instant URL creation without database latency.
- **Built comprehensive testing infrastructure** with multi-database mocking (SQLite, mongomock, fakeredis), async pytest framework, httpx API client testing, and isolated test environments.
- **Automated AWS infrastructure** with VPC setup, security groups, bastion host access, and monitoring via `Celery Flower` dashboard.

**Production-grade autoscaling system for K3s clusters with 4-layer intelligent scaling architecture, ML-based predictive scaling, and multi-AZ high availability**

- **Architected 4-layer autoscaling system**: (1) Data Collection for ML training, (2) Time-Aware Scaling with peak/off-peak thresholds (85%/60% vs 60%/40%), (3) Flash Sale Detection with emergency response to CPU spikes >30% in 2 minutes, (4) Predictive Scaling using Prophet models forecasting CPU 15 minutes ahead.
- **Implemented ML training pipeline** with Kubernetes CronJob for automated weekly model retraining, feature engineering (temporal cyclical encoding, lag features, rolling statistics), time-series cross-validation, and backtesting with MAE/RMSE metrics tracking.
- **Built event-driven Lambda architecture** with four specialized functions (Decision, Scale-Up, Scale-Down, Cleanup) orchestrated through EventBridge for fault tolerance, crash recovery via Write-Ahead Log (WAL), and distributed locking with 200s timeout.
- **Designed multi-AZ high availability** with round-robin worker distribution across 3 availability zones (ap-southeast-1a/b/c), single NAT Gateway optimization, and LIFO scale-down maintaining natural distribution balance.
- **Implemented multi-layer idempotency** including bootstrap verification, cooldown checks (scale-up: 300s, scale-down: 900s), pending instance detection, and automatic stale flag cleanup to prevent duplicate scaling operations.
- **Integrated comprehensive observability** with 17 CloudWatch alarms (CRITICAL/WARNING severity), Prometheus health graceful degradation (conservative defaults when unavailable), and fixed LogGroups for stable dashboard references.
- **Engineered spot instance support** with automatic On-Demand fallback when spot capacity unavailable (InsufficientInstanceCapacity, SpotInstanceCapacityNotAvailable, MaxSpotInstanceCountExceeded), graceful 2-minute interruption handling, and proper node cleanup.

**Tech Stack:** `AWS Lambda` `EventBridge` `DynamoDB` `EC2` `K3s` `Prometheus` `CloudWatch` `Prophet` `Kubernetes CronJob` `SSM` `Secrets Manager` `S3` `Python 3.11` `Pulumi` `Ansible` `kubectl` `Node Exporter`

- Event-driven architecture patterns with Lambda chaining via EventBridge
- Distributed systems state management with DynamoDB and WAL patterns
- ML pipeline deployment with automated retraining and model versioning
- Multi-AZ infrastructure design with cost optimization (single NAT, spot instances)
